After a long time of hesitation, I have finally decided to start writing a blog. In the past years, I have been writing a lot – mostly for work and studies. But I have never had a place where I could share my thoughts, or interesting problems and solutions that I have worked on. All beginnings are difficult, but at least I wrote an introduction post. It’s a start. I will blog mostly about software engineering. I know that I will not blog every day, not even every week. I will write a new blog post whenever I stumble upon something that I think others will find useful. But I do hope this will happen at least every couple of months.
