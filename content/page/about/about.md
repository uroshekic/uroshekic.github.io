TLDR: Software engineer, husband, father.

Hi!

I’m a Software Engineer living in [Ljubljana](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Ljubljana/) ([Slovenia](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Slovenia/)), and working for a company called Outfit7. I’m passionate about technology, software engineering, I like to run or go for a bike ride when it’s not raining, I like skiing in the winter, and I love reading good books.
